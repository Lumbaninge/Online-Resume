<h2>Lumbani's Portfolio </h2>

  <p>Being a self-motivated, self-powered and enthusiastic worker has led me to gain vast experience in many fields. This along with my compassionate and friendly attitude, I have committed my skills to help others, both in my professional and personal life. I ensure that I embrace people from all walks of life, ensuring that no situation will determine that dignity and respect with which someone is treated. I am confident, hard-working and committed to any challenge or task that I take on and will not rest until I have completed the task well. By constantly raising the bar, I ensure that the quality and efficiency of my output is constantly improving.</p>
